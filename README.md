# DIVKIT

**DivKit** üêã is an open source Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework.
SDUI is a an emerging technique that leverage the server to build the user interfaces of their mobile apps.

The convenience of DivKit as a server-driven UI technology is that it doesn‚Äôt require much at the start. You can transfer a view or even a particular element (such as a card or button) to Divs. At the very beginning, even a server isn‚Äôt needed: DivKit is easy to use as a framework that facilitates development. You can include all data on the client-side, and when the server response mechanism becomes available, the app can start receiving updates right away.

We‚Äôve made a sandbox for you to experiment with. The DivKit web engine is connected to it, but you can also download iOS/Android app demos from stores and link them to the sandbox. The data will be updated live: the sandbox connects to the playground app via web sockets.
